This week in IT we did some improvements to our github websites. I wanted to add a border around my writing, but I decided not to make a chunky line border because it doesn't look very neat on a website. So instead I decided to use a shadow effect around my work, as it looks neat and professional. Within this border I also created block colour for my writing to sit on, making it easily readable. I also changed the container size in the code, so that more of the screen is filled. In my previous blog post, you can also see an embedded version of my google sheets that I have added in.
