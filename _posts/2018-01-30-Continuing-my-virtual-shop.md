This week, I continued to advance with my Virtual shop Spreadsheet. I added other spendings, such as running the shop, and paying the employees, which meant that I could also add my own wage. I have also started trying to add discount codes, although it is proving difficult to achieve, as I am unsure how to make the If statements work.
