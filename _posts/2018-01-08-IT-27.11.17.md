This lesson was the first of this year in IT. We started to look at spreadsheets. We made a document called Virtual shop, in which we planned to create an interactive spreadsheet that will help to tell you the individual and total cost of the items that you select. 

We made a list of items and gave them prices, I did 15 different items, and then created a box that would take the item you had written in the box next to it, and tell you the price. To do this, we used the vlookup command, and selected the section of the spreadsheet that had the items and their prices in. We then added in a total price column, which added together the quantity column, and the price column, which would calculate the sum of the price and the quantity. Finally, we coded a complete total box, which added up all the total price boxes in the column, to find the price of all the items bought.
