    <td>This week, I was not in for the whole lesson, and so did not end up doing much work. Not much went very well, to be honest.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>It now seems that me being diver does not work very well. As it appears, I need to work on my speed when typing, as well as my accuracy. Setting up was also slow, and saving work did not seem to work as normal, unusually. Harry would also wait for me to finish typing, before carrying on, which annoyed me. Overall it was not a very good week.</td>
