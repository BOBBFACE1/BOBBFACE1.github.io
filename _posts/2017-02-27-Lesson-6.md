    <td>This week, I was navigator again, which happened to involve a lot of speaking very precisely, as once we finished the code, we had to create another, improved one, which turned out to be an extremely long and extensive code. It involved a lot of variables, and even changing the text size, and background and text colour for each different question asked by the computer.
I found that mentioning spaces was not important with things like fontscale, or wait, as my partner Harry already knew where spaces were needed for these, however when it came to something either fairly, or completely new, I mentioned all the details that could be wanted.</td>
