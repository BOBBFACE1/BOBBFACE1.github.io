This week, we started with the idea that a letter, when made to look 3D, it is in fact just two of the same shape, with one offset slightly to the other, most commonly at a 45 degree angle. From this premise, we preceded to create a capital letter T, using python with turtle, on repl.it. I created code to draw the letter T, to move down and to the right, and then to do the same again, each in a different colour. The problem we found with this was that it looked simply like a letter with a shadow, not a three dimensional shape. To realise this effect, I created a copied version of the code i used to make the first T, and changed it so that it would draw lines in three of the corners. I then used this piece of code to create the second T. I now had an outline that looked like a 3D T, but the problem was that when coloured in, there were small areas which still appears white, in the corners where I had placed the effect of joining the two shapes. To get around this problem, I decided to make a new function for the drawing of a T again, but to make some changes this time. I wrote the code so that, instead of creating the letter T, it created the outline of the entire 3D object. I then used this to make the first T, and then edited the second to add only a singular line, in the top right corner to join the two shapes.

This was my finished product:
