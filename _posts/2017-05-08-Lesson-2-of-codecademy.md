    <td>Today, I managed to make decent progress on the course. I read the information on the left hand side of the screen very carefully, as the more you progress into the coding, the more important it becomes to do this at the start of every stage. Focusing, and thinking about what was written meant that I could commonly complete each exercise with only some typing mistakes. However, I did sometimes get things wrong with the coding completely, in which case, I would study my error very closely, and if I still was clueless, I would read the left hand side some more, and I even once used the very handy hint. I would commonly repeat this process if I had made more that one mistake, and I therefore received another error message.</td>

    <td>I sometimes get distracted by the struggling of other people, and though it helps them to learn better, I feel it may hinder me, as I experienced with a problem I was only able to complete once I was at home, working out what to do, by myself.</td>
