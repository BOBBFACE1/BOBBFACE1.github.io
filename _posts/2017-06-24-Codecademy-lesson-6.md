This week, me and my friends helped each other a lot, by pointing out certain things to look for, or making sure they had completed all the instructions. This meant that when one of us made a mistake, another could quickly remind them to check for things that they commonly did wrong, meaning we could find the problem quickly, without doing the work for each other.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I found out that it is useful to always keep something, such as a variable, on the same side of the equals sign, consistently in a block of code. I remained stuck on one section for quite a while, because of this.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
Next time, I will focus on the smaller things, and try all combinations of brackets, or equation orders to find solutions.</td>
