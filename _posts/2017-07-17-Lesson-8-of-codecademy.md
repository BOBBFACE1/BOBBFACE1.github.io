This week, I  did some questions that I found quite difficult, which I did manage to get through in the end. I did this by working with Soham, who sits nearby, and as with the previous week, we worked together to point out things to look for. One question, however needed to be explained by the teacher, and we had not used a certain function before.
I am now close to completing the necessary 57%.</td>
