    <td>This week, it was only me doing the work, as my partner was not there.. This meant I had to read everything from the book, and type in all the code as well. This actually worked a lot better than with two people, as it meant I had a fuller understanding of what the code was, what it did, and how everything actually worked. It felt like I was moving at a much faster rate, as no communication was needed.
I copied the code well, and was able to move the robot arm, and even make it draw things, by the end of the lesson:

    <td>I think that a slow set up was the only thing that could have been improved on.</td>

    <td>Next week I will try and set up faster, which should be possible, as I now have used the robot arm before.</td>
