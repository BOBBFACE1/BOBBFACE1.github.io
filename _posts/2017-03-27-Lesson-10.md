    <td>Today it took me and Harry a long time to get going, however, I think we did well in eventually working out the rough problem that we were having. Unfortunately, we were unable to get much work done, and were only able to try using the robot arm to try and pick things up:

    <td>I need to get faster at identifying problems, outside of code. The problem was that our Fuze Box was strange, and the pi basic did not work properly, as well as the computer not being able to see the robot arm. We went through four different robots, checking and changing the code a lot, before we decided that it was the Fuze.</td>
