This week, I prepared my virtual shop to be expanded. I moved the buying part of the sheet onto another sheet, for it to be the front of house type aspect of my shop. The stock, and prices, changed, and I also added new columns, like margin and expenditure columns, which make the sheet clearer, and easier to see which items are the best to sell most of, which is very useful in a shop senario.

This has prepared my document so that I will be able to add discounts, and other spendings to find out the true profit of my shop, and my own wage, after paying staff ect.
