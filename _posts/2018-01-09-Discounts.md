This week, we attempted to incorporate a discount system into our virtual shop sheets document. What I aimed to create was a system in which you could enter the percentage discount that you wanted, and then if you had spent a certain amount, then the discount would apply to the overall cost. To achieve this, I created a box to write in the discount percentage, and below it, a decimal equivalent of the remainder, using (100-*discount percentage*)/100. Underneath this is a box where you can write the amount needed to be paid for the discount to apply, and underneath that is the end total box. The end total box uses an *if * statement to check if the price has been met, and if it has, it will multiply the sum total to the discount remainder decimal.
