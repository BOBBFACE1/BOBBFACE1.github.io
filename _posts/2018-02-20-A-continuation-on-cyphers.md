This week, we continued on our 'cypher' spreadsheets, but moving away from the simple Caesar Cypher. We have started now to look at binary instead, and using Ascii as well to form coded messages. Using Ascii means that we can do more with the coding, and create more complex cyphers. It also means that there is representation for punctuation and spacing, which you cannot have in a simple cypher. We copied an ascii table, and changed the binary so that it was all 8 bit. We then used a simple vloopup to change the letters into binary.  We also learned a new funtion - CONCATENATE.
