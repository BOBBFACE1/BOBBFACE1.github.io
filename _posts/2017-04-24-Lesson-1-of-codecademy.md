    <td>This week, we started to learn how to use python, through the amazing online interactive source, Codecademy. I found that, though it may seem daunting to start a new programming language, it was relatively simple if I used my brain. Reading all the information found on the left hand side of the screen carefully, was the only way through with the most minimal errors occurring. Reading everything also meant that I could understand each command, and learn how it can be used in different contexts, not only copying out what I thought i must do.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I only made a couple of mistakes, these being easily correctable, and simply being because I had not looked at what was commented on my screen, and only on the left hand side.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will continue to do what I did this week, but with increasing speed and precision.</td>
