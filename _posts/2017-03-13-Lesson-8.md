    <td>All that we did was new to me, this week, and so I was very happy that I was starting to understand how everything was working, physically with the wires. Officially I was navigator, and Harry was driver, but we worked together on both of these things. By the end of the lesson, though we had a slow and rocky start, we were able to make out where everything went, and for the most part, why. We called in a friend to help us decide where the sockets were, and what was what, as they were different to the diagram.
