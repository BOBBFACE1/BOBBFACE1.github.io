This week, I started to use a new website for coding, called repl.it. It is a website that has a wide range of different code types, that you can use and code in. We are using python, and it is perhaps the most useful coding program to learn, and is also the one that we used in Codecademy last year. We have started off with the simple idea of being able to have a conversation with a computer, which meant that we started by coding the program to run simple questions. However, I learnt that the problem with this was that there was too many else ifs to write about the infinite range that an open question gives. Instead we use a 'while true' loop, which will run continually, unless told to ‘break’. Combining this with a closed question means that there are only two ‘ifs’ and one ‘else’. Both ifs have ‘break’ at the end, whereas the ‘else’ does not. This means that the loop will run forever, and the program will continually ask the question, until a valid answer is inputed.
