This week, we did not do any coding, as instead, we looked at how we do not naturally talk as a computer, and that we made many assumptions that you cannot make when coding. We attempted to explain how to make a cup of tea, but discovered that we made many errors.

We also looked at how Small things can create bigger things, and we were shown a piece of code, that created a game, that our teacher had written. He showed us that he had spent hours trying to work out how to code something, and had a big block of code, but that he found someone had already defined the function, and it was in the general access python information library.</td>
