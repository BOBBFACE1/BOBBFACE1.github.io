This week we attempted to use our skills in spreadsheets to create a cipher encoder and decoder. We tried creating a caesar cipher, with a three letter change. This was quite simple, so I decided to make a sheet that you could change the number of letters each letter changed by . This was quite a lot more difficult, but I managed it anyway, using a lot of different columns on the left, which each vlookup could refer to.
