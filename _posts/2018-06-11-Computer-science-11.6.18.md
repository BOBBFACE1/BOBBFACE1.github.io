Although we have been using computers for a long time at school, we haven't actually been taught how they work. Today we looked at binary and hexadecimal. Binary works the same as any other base mathematics, its just that we are used to using base 10, with digits 0-9, whereas binary (which is in base 2) only uses 0 and 1. This is very useful for many things, especially computers, as there is only two possibilities: on or off. We learnt how convert this into hexadecimal, which uses two digits to represent the 8 bits (byte), one for each 4 bits (nibble)
