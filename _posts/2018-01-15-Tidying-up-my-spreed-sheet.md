This week, I did not add much to my virtual shop spreadsheet, as I instead changed the look of it, to make it more readable. I achieved this by grouping together everything i had done into a table, adding outlines to the boxes that I used. The important parts, such as titles are now coloured as well, making it more readable.

As well as tidying  up the format, I also changed what the shop was selling to clothes instead of tuck shop style food, just as the price differences gave the shop a different feel. The way that the totals and discount works has been changed slightly, as I have added a new box containing the amount that is taken off the subtotal, and changing the grand total tso that it takes that away from the subtotal.
